# Proposal

## What problem does your app solve?
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- What is the mission statement?

* This application is meant to solve the issue where students or young ones collected in an area gradually rise  up to an extremely loud decibel level.
* This application encourages young ones to be as quiet as possible collectively decibel sound-level wise in order to cause collectible and point scored animals.
* To grace the screen of an application that launches and monitors the sound level through a microphone. Classes can compete on daily scoreboards to see which class performed the best and can gain in game rare appearances from special animals and creatures (this functionality still in development for future refinement and release).

# Mission Statement
*We aim to make Noise Controller as easy to use for as wide of a range of users as possible and help them gain a little piece of quiet in order to help them do their work peacefully.

#Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

* Onboarding process for new teacher to sign up, including their class name.
* Main page: Every 'x' number of seconds a new creature comes out if it's quiet enough. If the noise level in the room reaches a certain point, the animals are all scared away. This will involve a listener to detect sound.
* Ability for the user to set how sensitive they want the microphone to be. Ability for user to set how many seconds they want between a new animal coming out (could also be random).
* Show a live score on the page, and final score page at the end of each day. (ie start at 100 and -10 every time they scare the animals.  You choose how to score)
*Page for the class to view their daily score records over time


#Features for a later release-
* Special Creatures that get released after a student group is under a certain decibel level for a reasonable period of time.


# Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)


* For the Front End UI I used Google Fonts for several of my fonts to influence the round styling and bubble nature of the page and icons.

#For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

#Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?


* The target audience is those who deal with young people either in groups or silently when trying to maintain a  certain level of lower decibel volume by incentivizing that same young group to maintain quiet in a * game-oriented fashion. That could be teachers, home educators, daycare workers or even just family members seeking a lower volume level for a period of time through using a game.

#Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
